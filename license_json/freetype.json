The license\naffects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\ndocumentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\nThis  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\nand  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\nalike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\no We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\ninterested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\no You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\nfull form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\no You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\nit, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\nsomewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\nFreeType code. (`credits')\n\nWe  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\nsoftware, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\nWe  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\nassume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\nFinally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\ncredit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\nencourage you to use the following text:\n\n\"\"\"\nPortions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType\nProject (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\n\"\"\"\n\nPlease replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you\nactually use.\n\n\nLegal Terms\n===========\n\n0.

We also\nencourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\ndocumentation, though this isn't mandatory.\n\nThese conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\nthe FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.

Advertising\n--------------\n\nNeither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\nthe name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\npurposes without specific prior written permission.\n\nWe suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\nfollowing phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\nor advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\n`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\n\nAs  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\naccept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\nmaterial, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\nauthors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\nTherefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\nProject, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\nof this license.\n\n4.
