You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed\nentirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a\n\"FLOSS Work\") licensed under one or more of the licenses\nlisted below in section 1, as long as:\na. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the\nDerivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the\nDerivative Work which are not derived from the Program,\nand which can reasonably be considered independent and\nseparate works in themselves,\nb. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which\nare not derived from the Program, and which can\nreasonably be considered independent and separate works\nin themselves,\ni. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses\nlisted below, and\nii. the object code or executable form of those sections\nare accompanied by the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code for those sections on\nthe same medium and under the same FLOSS license as\nthe corresponding object code or executable forms of\nthose sections, and\nc. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a\nDerivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution\nmedium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves\nwhich are not derivatives of either the Program, a\nDerivative Work or a FLOSS Work.\nIf the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only\nbe copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and\nconditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from\nMySQL AB.\n\n2. FLOSS License List\n\nLicense name Version(s)/Copyright Date\nAcademic Free License 2.0\nApache Software License 1.0/1.1/2.0\nApple Public Source License 2.0\nArtistic license From Perl 5.8.0\nBSD license \"July 22 1999\"\nCommon Development and Distribution License (CDDL) 1.0\nCommon Public License 1.0\nEclipse Public License 1.0\nGNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License (LGPL) 2.0/2.1\nJabber Open Source License 1.0\nMIT license (As listed in file MIT-License.txt) ---\nMozilla Public License (MPL) 1.0/1.1\nOpen Software License 2.0\nOpenSSL license (with original SSLeay license) \"2003\" (\"1998\")\nPHP License 3.0\nPython license (CNRI Python License) ---\nPython Software Foundation License 2.1.1\nSleepycat License \"1999\"\nUniversity of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License ---\nW3C License \"2001\"\nX11 License \"2001\"\nZlib/libpng License ---\nZope Public License 2.0\n\nDue to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we\nrequire that any version follow the 2003 version of the Free\nSoftware Foundation's Free Software Definition\n(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of\nthe Open Source Definition by the Open Source Initiative\n(http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php).\n\n3. Definitions\n\na. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the\nmeaning provided in the GPL.\nb. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright\nlaw.\n\n4. Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs\nthat contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the\nProgram may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS\nException. If you create or distribute a work which is a\nDerivative Work of both the Program and any other work\nlicensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not\navailable for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS\nException notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all\nrespects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may\nchoose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under\nthe terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice\nfrom that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has\nnever been modified by you or any third party.\n\nAppendix A. Qualified Libraries and Packages\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of libraries and packages\nwhich are covered by the FLOSS License Exception. Please note that\nthis appendix is provided merely as an additional service to\nspecific FLOSS projects wishing to simplify licensing information\nfor their users. Compliance with one of the licenses noted under\nthe \"FLOSS license list\" section remains a prerequisite.\n\nPackage Name                  Qualifying License and Version\nApache Portable Runtime (APR) Apache Software License 2.0"
