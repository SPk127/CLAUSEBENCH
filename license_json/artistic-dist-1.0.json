    "license_body": "\nThe \"Artistic License\"\n\nPreamble\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\nPackage may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\nsemblance of artistic control over the development of the Package,\nwhile giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\nthe Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\nreasonable modifications.\n\nIt also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in your own\nprograms without transferring this License to those programs, provided\nthat you meet some reasonable requirements.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\nCopyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\ncreated through textual modification.\n\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been\nmodified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\nof the Copyright Holder as specified below.\n\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or\ncopyrights for the package.\n\n\"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\nthis Package.\n\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the\nbasis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\nand so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\nCopyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\nas a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item\nitself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\nIt also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\nunder the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\nduplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\nderived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\nmodified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\nthat you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\nwhen you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\nfollowing:\n\na) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\nFreely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\nan equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\nsite such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\nyour modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n\nb) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\nc) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\nwith standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\na separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\ndocuments how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\nexecutable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\na) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\ntogether with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\nto get the Standard Version.\n\nb) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\nthe Package with your modifications.\n\nc) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\ndocument the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\nwith instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\nd) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\nPackage.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\nPackage.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\nyou may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\ncommercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\ndistribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\nproduct of your own.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\noutput from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\nunder the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\nthem, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\nPackage.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\nPackage via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a\nbinary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\nneither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\nfall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\nnot represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\nPackage.\n\n7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that\nyou explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left\nto your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated\ncopyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be\nclearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this\nlicense if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate\nconnection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.\nYou may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or\nchoose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the\ncontext of your package.\n\n8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\nproducts derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nThe End"
