You can also distribute\nunmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must\ninclude this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\nthat you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\nexamples and Vim scripts.\n\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,\nincluding executables and/or source code, when the following four\nconditions are met:\n1) This license text must be included unmodified.\n2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\na) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in\nthe distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you\n(in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you\nmust make your changes, including source code, available to the\nmaintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to\ninclude your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the\nmaintainer will do with your changes and under what license they\nwill be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation\nthen this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.\nThe current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this\nchanges it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely\nvim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely\nimpossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him\nyour changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has\nreceived your changes they will not have to be sent again.\nb) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as\nmentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\nunmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\ntext under a) applies to those changes.\nc) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\nthe modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a\ncontext diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you\nadd.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from\nmaking their own changes to the official version of Vim.\nd) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned\nunder c), you can distribute it without the source code for the\nchanges if the following three conditions are met:\n- The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\nthe changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\npermits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\nversion of Vim without fee or restriction.\n- You keep the changes for at least three years after last\ndistributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer\nor someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in\nany way) for the changes within this period, you must make them\navailable to him.\n- You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\ncontact information must remain valid for at least three years\nafter last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long\nas possible.\ne) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\nyou can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or\nany later version.\n3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\ncommand and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim\nis able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned\nunder 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does\nnot conflict with the license used for the changes.\n4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\nremoved or changed, except that the person himself can make\ncorrections.\n\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use\nthe Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\nmaintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\nby e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\nIf the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\ncontext diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\n<maintainer@vim.org>\n\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim\nsources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this\nlicense for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came\nwith, at your option.\n\n\nNote:\n\n- If you are happy with Vim, please express that by reading the rest of this\nfile and consider helping needy children in Uganda.\n\n- If you want to support further Vim development consider becoming a\n|sponsor|.  The money goes to Uganda anyway.\n\n- According to Richard Stallman the Vim license is GNU GPL compatible.\nA few minor changes have been made since he checked it, but that should not\nmake a difference.\n\n- If you link Vim with a library that goes under the GNU GPL, this limits\nfurther distribution to the GNU GPL.  Also when you didn't actually change\nanything in Vim.\n\n- Once a change is included that goes under the GNU GPL, this forces all\nfurther changes to also be made under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.\n\n- If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you can include your name and\ncontact information with the \"--with-modified-by\" configure argument or the\nMODIFIED_BY define."
