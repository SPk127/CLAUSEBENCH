No.168, Yung Chi Rd., Taipei, 110 Taiwan\nAll rights reserved except as specified below.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is forbidden.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and\nchange it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE specifically permits and\nencourages you to use this software, provided that you give the recipients all the\nrights that we gave you and make sure they can get the modifications of this\nsoftware.\n\nLegal Terms\n\n0. Definitions:\nThroughout this License, \"Font\" means the TrueType fonts \"AR PL Mingti2L Big5\",\n\"AR PL KaitiM Big5\" (BIG-5 character set) and \"AR PL SungtiL GB\", \"AR PL KaitiM\nGB\" (GB character set) which are originally distributed by Arphic, and the\nderivatives of those fonts created through any modification including modifying\nglyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting\nsome characters in/from glyph table.\n\n\"PL\" means \"Public License\".\n\n\"Copyright Holder\" means whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the\nFont.\n\n\"You\" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or modifying the Font.\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that you have the freedom to copy or modify the Font as\nwell as redistribute copies of the Font under the same conditions you received,\nnot price. If you wish, you can charge for this service.\n\n1. Copying & Distribution\n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any medium, without\nrestriction, provided that you retain this license file (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered\nin all copies.\n\n2. Modification\n\nYou may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including modifying\nglyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting\nsome characters in/from glyph table, and copy and distribute such modifications\nunder the terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\na) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating how and when\nyou changed that file.\n\nb) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to all third\nparties under the terms of this License, such as by offering access to copy the\nmodifications from a designated place, or distributing the modifications on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nc) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when run, you must\ncause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,\nto print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and\na notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty)\nand that users may redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the\nuser how to view a copy of this License.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\nof that work are not derived from the Font, and can be reasonably considered\nindependent and separate works in themselves, then this License and its terms, do\nnot apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore,\nmere aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a volume\nof a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope\nof this License.\n\n3. Condition Subsequent\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or\ndistribute the Font will automatically retroactively void your rights under this\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies or rights from you under this\nLicense will keep their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full\ncompliance.\n\n4. Acceptance\n\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, sublicense or\ndistribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\nLicense. Therefore, by copying, modifying, sublicensing or distributing the Font,\nyou indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions.\n\n5. Automatic Receipt\n\nEach time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically receives a\nlicense from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Font subject\nto these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for\nenforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n6. Contradiction\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or\nfor any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you\n(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of\nthis License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you\ncannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\ndistribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive copies directly\nor indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n7. NO WARRANTY\n\nBECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FONT, TO\nTHE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING\nTHE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE FONT \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE\nRISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT\nPROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n8. DAMAGES WAIVER\n\nUNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY\nCOPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT\nAS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO\nUSE THE FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR\nSERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH\nHOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."
