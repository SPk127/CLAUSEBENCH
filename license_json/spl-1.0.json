You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\nversion that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\nLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\nan additional document offering the additional rights described in\nSection 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\nmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\neither on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\nExecutable version available; and if made available via Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\nmonths after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\nhas been made available to such recipients.

You may choose to offer, and to\ncharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\nobligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\nmay do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\nany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\noffered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\nDeveloper and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6.

You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\nCode or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\ncontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\nExecutable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\nrights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\nLicense. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\nlicense You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\nfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\nDeveloper or any Contributor.

All\nsublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\nsurvive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\nshall survive.\n\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\nclaim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\nor a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\nYou file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging\nthat:\n\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\nParticipant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\nshall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\nunless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\nagree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\nroyalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\nthe Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days\nof notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\nmutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\nis not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\nthe 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\nany rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\nand 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\nsold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\nParticipant.\n\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\nalleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\nby license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\ninfringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\ngranted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\nlicense.\n\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\nall\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\nwhich have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\nOR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\nCHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\nCOMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\nINFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\nLIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\nRESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
