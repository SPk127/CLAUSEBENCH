As such, the official license truly is:\n\nEULA: The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other words, you cannot\nclaim the text of the code as your own and resell it.\n\nUsing the code is permitted in any program, product, or library, non-commercial\nor commercial. Giving credit is not required, though is a nice gesture.\n\nThe code comes as-is, and if there are any flaws or problems with any Gems code,\nnobody involved with Gems - authors, editors, publishers, or webmasters - are to\nbe held responsible. Basically, don't be a jerk, and remember that anything free\ncomes with no guarantee."
