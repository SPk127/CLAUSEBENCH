The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed\nonly under the terms of this License or a future version of this License\nreleased under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License\nwith every copy of the Source Code You distribute.

Availability of Source Code.\n\nAny Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer\nin Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License.\n\n3.3.

You must include a prominent statement that the\nModification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code\nprovided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial\nDeveloper in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable\nversion or related documentation in which You describe the origin or\nownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4.

If You created one or more Modification(s) You\nmay add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.\nYou must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source\nCode where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating\nto Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\n\n3.6.
