By contrast, the GNU General\nPublic License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\nchange free software--to make sure the software is free for all\nits users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\nSoftware Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation\nsoftware is covered by the GNU Library General Public License\ninstead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\ncharge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code\nor can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or\nuse pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\nfor you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify\nit.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\nthat you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can\nget the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps:\n\n(1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to\ncopy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\ncertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\nthis free software. If the software is modified by someone else\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have\nis not the original, so that any problems introduced by others\nwill not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making\nthe program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\nthat any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\nlicensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License. The\n\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work\nbased on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative\nwork under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\nis included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are\nnot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act\nof running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the\nProgram is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on\nthe Program (independent of having been made by running the\nProgram). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep\nintact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\nabsence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange\nfor a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any\nportion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy\nand distribute such modifications or work under the terms of\nSection 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\nnot normally print such an announcement, your work based on the\nProgram is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\nProgram, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\nworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\napply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which\nis a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must\nbe on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\nlicensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every\npart regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\ncontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\nintent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\nderivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\nProgram with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on\na volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\nother work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\nof Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\nfollowing:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\ninterchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete\nsource code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\nplus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\nused to control compilation and installation of the executable.\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\nkernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable\nruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\nfrom you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\nor distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions\nare prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\nbased on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this\nLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on\nthe Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\nthe original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program\nsubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\ngranted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\nby third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\npatent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\npatent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\norder, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of\nthis License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\nProgram at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only\nway you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\nentirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\nunder any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\nintended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\nin other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe\nany patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\nof any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of\nprotecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,\nwhich is implemented by public license practices. Many people have\nmade generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent\napplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\nif he or she is willing to distribute software through any other\nsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\nto be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\nthe original copyright holder who places the Program under this\nLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\nin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\nthis License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies a version number of this License which applies\nto it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\nthe terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\nversion published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\ndoes not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\nany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other\nfree programs whose distribution conditions are different, write\nto the author to ask for permission. For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\nthe sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR\nOR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\nMODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\nOR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\nOTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nSection 4 - 3rd Party Components\n\n(1) The Software Program includes software and documentation components\ndeveloped in part by Silver Egg Technology, Inc.(\"SET\") prior to 2001\nand released under the following license.\n\nCopyright (c) 2001 Silver Egg Technology\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sub-license, and/or\nsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNON-INFRINGEMENT.
