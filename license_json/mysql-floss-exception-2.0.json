You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely\nfrom the Program and one or more works (each, a \"FLOSS Work\") licensed\nunder one or more of the licenses listed below in section 1, as long as:\na. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the Derivative\nWork, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not\nderived from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered\nindependent and separate works in themselves,\nb. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived\nfrom the Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and\nseparate works in themselves,\ni. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and\nii. the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by\nthe complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections\non the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as\nthe corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and\nc. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative\nWork on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the\nGPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves\nwhich are not derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative Work or a\nFLOSS Work.\nIf the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied,\nmodified, distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or\nanother valid licensing option from MySQL AB.\n2.

Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs that contain\na notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the Program may be distributed\nunder the terms of this FLOSS Exception. If you create or distribute a work\nwhich is a Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work licensed\nunder the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not available for that work;\nthus, you must remove the FLOSS Exception notice from that work and comply\nwith the GPL in all respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You\nmay choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under the\nterms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that copy of\nthe Program, provided that the copy has never been modified by you or any\nthird party.\nAppendix A. Qualified Libraries and Packages\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of libraries and packages which are\ncovered by the FLOSS License Exception. Please note that this appendix is\nprovided merely as an additional service to\nspecific FLOSS projects wishing to simplify licensing information for their\nusers. Compliance with one of the licenses noted under the \"FLOSS license\nlist\" section remains a prerequisite.\nPackage Name Qualifying License and Version\nApache Portable Runtime (APR) Apache Software License 2.0"
