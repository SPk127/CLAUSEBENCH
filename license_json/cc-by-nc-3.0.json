The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\nof this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\nIdentifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\nDistribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\non the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\nthe recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\nrecipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\nWork. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\nto the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\nDistribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\nPerform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\nmeasures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\nWork from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\nthe terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\nincorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\napart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\nLicense. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\nmust, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\nas required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an\nAdaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\npracticable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\nSection 4(c), as requested.\nb. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3\nabove in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward\ncommercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of\nthe Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing\nor otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed\ntoward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided\nthere is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with\nthe exchange of copyrighted works.\nc. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\nCollections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\nSection 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\nprovide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\nname of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\nand/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\nor parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\nattribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\nterms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\nor parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\nextent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\nspecifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\nrefer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\nand, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\na credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n\"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay\nbased on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by\nthis Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\nprovided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\na minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\nauthors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\ncredits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\nother contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\nuse the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\nin the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\nLicense, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\nconnection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\nLicensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\nuse of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\npermission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\nParties.\nd.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\ncompulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves\nthe exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by\nYou of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of\nsuch rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than\nnoncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives\nthe right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\nlicensing scheme; and,\niii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to\ncollect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\nLicensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\nvoluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\nby You of the rights granted under this License that is for a\npurpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted\nunder Section 4(c).\ne.

Licensor\nagrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\nof the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\nmake Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\nmodification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\nAuthor's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\nas appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\napplicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\nright under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\nbut not otherwise.\n\n5.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\nOF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\nautomatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\nIndividuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\nfrom You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\nterminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\ncompliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\nsurvive any termination of this License.\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\nWork under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\nany time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\nthe Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\nterms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\nb.

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\nby the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\nenforceable.\nd. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\nbreach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\nand signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\ne. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\nrespect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\nagreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\nhere. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\nmay appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\nmodified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\nf.
