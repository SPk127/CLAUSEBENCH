By contrast, the GNU General\nPublic License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\nchange free software--to make sure the software is free for all\nits users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\nSoftware Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation\nsoftware is covered by the GNU Library General Public License\ninstead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\ncharge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code\nor can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or\nuse pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\nfor you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify\nit.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\nthat you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can\nget the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps:\n\n(1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to\ncopy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\ncertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for\nthis free software. If the software is modified by someone else\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have\nis not the original, so that any problems introduced by others\nwill not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making\nthe program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\nthat any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not\nlicensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be\ndistributed under the terms of this General Public License. The\n\"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work\nbased on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative\nwork under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\nand/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\nis included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are\nnot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act\nof running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the\nProgram is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on\nthe Program (independent of having been made by running the\nProgram). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep\nintact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\nabsence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange\nfor a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any\nportion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy\nand distribute such modifications or work under the terms of\nSection 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\nnot normally print such an announcement, your work based on the\nProgram is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\nProgram, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\nworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\napply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which\nis a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must\nbe on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\nlicensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every\npart regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\ncontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\nintent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\nderivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\nProgram with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on\na volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\nother work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\nof Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\nfollowing:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\ninterchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete\nsource code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\nplus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\nused to control compilation and installation of the executable.\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\nkernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable\nruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\nfrom you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\nor distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions\nare prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\nbased on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this\nLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on\nthe Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\nthe original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program\nsubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\ngranted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\nby third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\npatent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\npatent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\norder, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of\nthis License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\nProgram at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only\nway you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\nentirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\nunder any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\nintended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\nin other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe\nany patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\nof any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of\nprotecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,\nwhich is implemented by public license practices. Many people have\nmade generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent\napplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\nif he or she is willing to distribute software through any other\nsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\nto be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\nthe original copyright holder who places the Program under this\nLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\nin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\nthis License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies a version number of this License which applies\nto it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\nthe terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\nversion published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\ndoes not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\nany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other\nfree programs whose distribution conditions are different, write\nto the author to ask for permission. For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\nstatus of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting\nthe sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR\nOR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\nMODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\nOR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\nOTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nSection 5 - GPLv3 License Agreement\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright c 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of\nthis license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are\ndesigned to take away your freedom to share and change the works.\nBy contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\nprogram--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\nWe, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public\nLicense for most of our software; it applies also to any other\nwork released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your\nprograms, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\ncharge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can\nget it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\npieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do\nthese things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the\nfreedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,\nreceive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\nterms so they know their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two\nsteps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you\nthis License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly\nexplains that there is no warranty for this free software. For\nboth users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified\nversions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be\nattributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with\nthe aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products\nfor individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most\nunacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL\nto prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems\narise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend\nthis provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as\nneeded to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software\npatents. States should not allow patents to restrict development\nand use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those\nthat do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied\nto a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To\nprevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to\nrender the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public\nLicense.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other\nkinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the\nwork in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the\nmaking of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified\nversion\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier\nwork.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work\nbased on the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it\non a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\ncopying, distribution (with or without modification), making\navailable to the public, and in some countries other activities as\nwell.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables\nother parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a\nuser through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is\nnot conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently\nvisible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,\nand (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work\n(except to the extent that warranties are provided), that\nlicensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view\na copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user\ncommands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list\nmeets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an\nofficial standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in\nthe case of interfaces specified for a particular programming\nlanguage, one that is widely used among developers working in that\nlanguage.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything,\nother than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal\nform of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that\nMajor Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work\nwith that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface\nfor which an implementation is available to the public in source\ncode form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major\nessential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the\nspecific operating system (if any) on which the executable work\nruns, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code\ninterpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means\nall the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an\nexecutable work) run the object code and to modify the work,\nincluding scripts to control those activities. However, it does\nnot include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools\nor generally available free programs which are used unmodified in\nperforming those activities but which are not part of the work.\nFor example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition\nfiles associated with source files for the work, and the source\ncode for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that\nthe work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate\ndata communication or control flow between those subprograms and\nother parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running\na covered work is covered by this License only if the output,\ngiven its content, constitutes a covered work. This License\nacknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as\nprovided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise\nremains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the\nsole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for\nyou, or provide you with facilities for running those works,\nprovided that you comply with the terms of this License in\nconveying all material for which you do not control copyright.\nThose thus making or running the covered works for you must do\nso exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control,\non terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section\n10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under\narticle 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December\n1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of\nsuch measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to\nforbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License\nwith respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention\nto limit operation or modification of the work as a means of\nenforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal\nrights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\nnotice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the\ncode; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;\nand give all recipients a copy of this License along with the\nProgram.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you\nconvey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a\nfee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications\nto produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under\nthe terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep\nintact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and\nindependent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the\ncovered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a\nlarger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\nmedium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its\nresulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal\nrights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works\npermit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause\nthis License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-\nreadable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in\none of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\nSource from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\nprovided you inform other peers where the object code and\nCorresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\npublic at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is\nexcluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need\nnot be included in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means\nany tangible personal property which is normally used for\npersonal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed\nor sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether\na product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved\nin favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a\nparticular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use\nof that class of product, regardless of the status of the\nparticular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A\nproduct is a consumer product regardless of whether the product\nhas substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,\nunless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the\nproduct.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that\nUser Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.\nThe information must suffice to ensure that the continued\nfunctioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or\ninterfered with solely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,\nor specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying\noccurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession\nand use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in\nperpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction\nis characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this\nsection must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But\nthis requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party\nretains the ability to install modified object code on the User\nProduct (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not\ninclude a requirement to continue to provide support service,\nwarranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or\ninstalled by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it\nhas been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied\nwhen the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\noperation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for\ncommunication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\nprovided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\npublicly documented (and with an implementation available to the\npublic in source code form), and must require no special password\nor key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of\nthis License by making exceptions from one or more of its\nconditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the\nentire Program shall be treated as though they were included in\nthis License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable\nlaw. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,\nthat part may be used separately under those permissions, but the\nentire Program remains governed by this License without regard to\nthe additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part\nof it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered\nwork, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright\npermission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material\nyou add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright\nholders of that material) supplement the terms of this License\nwith terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\nor requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\nor authors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\nof it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\nfor any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\nimpose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as\nyou received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that\nit is governed by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document\ncontains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\nconveying under this License, you may add to a covered work\nmaterial governed by the terms of that license document, provided\nthat the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or\nconveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,\nyou must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in\nthe form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\nunder this License (including any patent licenses granted under\nthe third paragraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\nand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the\ncopyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some\nreasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you\nhave received notice of violation of this License (for any work)\nfrom that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30\ndays after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate\nthe licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from\nyou under this License. If your rights have been terminated and\nnot permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new\nlicenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer\ntransmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\nacceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you\npermission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions\ninfringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore,\nby modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your\nacceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\nLicense.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of\nan organization, or substantially all assets of one, or\nsubdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If\npropagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\neach party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work\nalso receives whatever licenses to the work the party's\npredecessor in interest had or could give under the previous\nparagraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source\nof the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\nhas it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you\nmay not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for\nexercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not\ninitiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\nlawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,\nusing, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any\nportion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under\nthis License of the Program or a work on which the Program is\nbased. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's\n\"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired\nor hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,\npermitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its\ncontributor version, but do not include claims that would be\ninfringed only as a consequence of further modification of the\ncontributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\"\nincludes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-\nfree patent license under the contributor's essential patent\nclaims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise\nrun, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any\nexpress agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\nenforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a\npatent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\"\nsuch a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement\nor commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent\nlicense, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available\nfor anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this\nLicense, through a publicly available network server or other\nreadily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the\nCorresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive\nyourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular\nwork, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements\nof this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\nrecipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge\nthat, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work\nin a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a\ncountry, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of,\na covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,\nmodify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the\npatent license you grant is automatically extended to all\nrecipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that\nare specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a\ncovered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third\nparty that is in the business of distributing software, under\nwhich you make payment to the third party based on the extent of\nyour activity of conveying the work, and under which the third\nparty grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered\nwork from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection\nwith copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made\nfrom those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with\nspecific products or compilations that contain the covered work,\nunless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license\nwas granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or\nlimiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement\nthat may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent\nlaw.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\nLicense, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other\npertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it\nat all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to\ncollect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you\nconvey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those\nterms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying\nthe Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work\nlicensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License\ninto a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The\nterms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is\nthe covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero\nGeneral Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through\na network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such\nnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but\nmay differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU\nGeneral Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you\nhave the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat numbered version or of any later version published by the\nFree Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a\nversion number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose\nany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that\nproxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently\nauthorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow\na later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE\nRISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\nSHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES\nAND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\nTHE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF\nTHE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely\napproximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\nconnection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of\nliability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n\nSection 6 - 3rd Party Components\n\n(1) The Software Program includes software and documentation components\ndeveloped in part by Silver Egg Technology, Inc.(\"SET\") prior to 2001\nand released under the following license.\n\nCopyright (c) 2001 Silver Egg Technology\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sub-license, and/or\nsell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNON-INFRINGEMENT.
