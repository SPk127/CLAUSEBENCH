See the addition of \"of\nyour choice\" to the text based on https://github.com/BrianGladman/aes/issues/7#issuecomment-155121598\nBrianGladman commented on Nov 9, 2015 Hi Jonas, I really wish now that I had not done this\ndual licensing as the BSD license should have been sufficient. But someone at the time wouldn't\naccept this and insisted on the GPL. You can interpret the GPL license on any of my code\nwherever it appears as \"ALTERNATIVELY, provided that this notice is retained in full, this\nproduct may be distributed under the terms of a GNU General Public License (GPL) of your\nchoice, in which case the provisions of this GPL apply INSTEAD OF those given above.\" I\nhope that helps, if not please get back to me.",
