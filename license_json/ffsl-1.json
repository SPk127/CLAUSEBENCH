    "license_body": "\nFloodgap Free Software License\n\nThe author of your software has chosen to distribute it under the\nFloodgap Free Software License. Although this software is without cost,\nit is not released under Copyleft or GPL, and there are differences\nwhich you should read. Your use of this software package constitutes\nyour binding acceptance without restriction.\n\nThis software is without cost\n\nThe Floodgap Free Software License (FFSL) has one overriding mandate:\nthat software using it, or derivative works based on software that uses\nit, must be free. By free we mean simply \"free as in beer\" -- you may\nput your work into open or closed source packages as you see fit,\nwhether or not you choose to release your changes or updates publicly,\nbut you must not ask any fee for it. (There are certain exceptions for\nfor-profit use which we will discuss below.)\n\nDefinitions and terms\n\nAuthor\nThe declared copyright owner of this software package.\n\nBinary\nA pre-compiled or pre-interpreted bytecode or machine language\nrepresentation of a software package not designed for further\nmodification and tied to a particular platform or architecture.\n\nDerivative work\nAny distribution (q.v.) that contains any modification to or\ndeviation from the official reference distribution (q.v.); or\nany software package significantly based on or integrally\nincluding the source code for its features, including but not\nlimited to supersets; subsets of a significant proportion;\nin-place patched changes to source or binary files; linking in\nas a library; binary-only distributions if the original package\nincluded source (even if the source was not modified prior to\ncompilation); or translations to another programming language,\narchitecture or operating system environment. Derivative works\nof packages released under this license are also considered\nsubject to this license.\n\nHowever, a software package that requires this package but does\nnot include it or is not based upon it, even if it will not\noperate without it, is not considered a derivative work. For\nexample, interpreted programs requiring an interpreter issued\nunder this license, assuming they are not distributed with any\nportion of the interpreter, are not derivative works.\n\nDistribution\nA packaged release of this software, either the author's\noriginal work (the \"reference distribution\") or a derivative\nwork based upon it.\n\nReference distribution\nA packaged release of this software explicitly designated as the\nofficial release, written by or on behalf of the Author with his\nor her explicit designation as official. Only exact copies of\nthe reference distribution may be called reference\ndistributions; all other forms are derivative works.\n\nSource code\nThe human-readable programming instructions of the package which\nmight be easily read as text and subsequently edited, but\nrequiring compilation or interpretation into binary before being\ndirectly useable.\n\nWhat you are permitted to do under this license\n\nPursuant to the remainder of the terms below,\n* You may freely use, copy, and disseminate this software package for\nany non-commercial purpose as well as the commercial purposes\npermitted below.\n* You may freely modify this package, including source code if\navailable. Your modifications need not be released, although you\nare encouraged to do so.\n* You may release your derivative works based upon this software in\npurely binary (non-source) form if you choose. You are not\nobligated to release any portion of your source code openly,\nalthough you are encouraged to do so.\n* If this package is a tool used for generation, compilation or\nmaintenance of works, including but not limited to readable\ndocuments, software packages or images (for example, compilers,\ninterpreters, translators, linkers, editors, assemblers or\ntypesetters), you may freely use it for that purpose, commercial or\notherwise, as the works made by this package are not considered\nsubject to this license unless specified otherwise within and may\nbe distributed under any desired license and/or offered for sale or\nrental. Any run-time library or run-time code section linked into\nthe output by a compiler or similar code-generating tool governed\nby this license is considered to be an integral part of the output,\nand its presence does not subject the generated work to this\nlicense either. (This is, of course, assuming you are not using\nsaid tools to generate a derivative work based on this package in\nviolation of the other license terms.)\nHowever, if you are linking or including a separately distributed\nlibrary that is under this license, no matter what tool you are\nusing to do the linking or inclusion, you are then considered to be\nmaking a derivative work based on that library and your work does\nfall under this license. To avoid this, do not include the library\nwith your work (even though it needs the library to function) and\ninstead offer the library separately without cost.\n* In addition to non-commercial use and the uses permitted above, you\nmay use this software package in any for-profit endeavour as long\nas it does not involve the specific sale or rental of this package.\nSome specific but by no means exhaustive examples are listed below.\nNote that some of these situations may require additional action be\ntaken to ensure compliance.\n+ If this package or a derivative work allows you to serve data\nor make data available to others (for example, web servers,\nmail servers, gopher servers, etc.), you may use it to serve\nany commercial content or in any commercial setting whether\nyou choose to charge a fee or not, as you are considered to be\nearning income from the content you serve and/or the services\nfacilitated by your business and not from the sale of this\npackage itself. (This is, of course, assuming that you are not\ncharging a fee for sale or rental of this package or a\nderivative work based on this package in violation of the\nother license terms.) Similarly, any data you may acquire from\nthe use of this package is yours, and not governed by this\nlicense in any way even if for-profit.\n+ If you are selling a product that includes this package or a\nderivative work either as part of your product's requirements\nfor function or as a bundled extra, such as an operating\nsystem distribution, you may charge a fee for your product as\nlong as you also make this package or said derivative work\navailable for free separately (such as by download or link\nback to this package's site), as you are considered to be\nrequesting a fee for your own product and the package is\nmerely included as a convenience to your users.\n+ If you offer installation of this package or a derivative work\nas a service, you may charge a fee for the act of installation\nas long as you also make this package or said derivative work\navailable for free (such as by download or link back to this\npackage's site), as you are considered to be requesting a fee\nfor the act of installation and not for the software you are\ninstalling.\n+ The Author may also grant, in writing, other specified\nexemptions for your particular commercial purpose that do not\ncontravene the spirit of this license or any license terms\nthis package additionally carries.\n* In your derivative works based on this package, you may choose to\noffer warranty support or guarantees of performance. This does not\nin any way make the original Author legally, financially or in any\nother respect liable for claims issued under your warranty or\nguarantee, and you are solely responsible for the fulfillment of\nyour terms even if the Author of the work you have based your work\nupon offers his or her own.\n* In your derivative works based on this package, you may further\nrestrict the acceptable uses of your package or situations in which\nit may be employed as long as you clearly state that your terms\napply only to your derivative work and not to the original\nreference distribution. However, you may not countermand or ignore,\ndirectly or otherwise, any restriction already made in the\nreference distribution's license, including in this document\nitself, in similar fashion to other licenses allowing compatible\nlicenses to co-govern a particular package's use.\n\nWhat you must not do under this license\n\nRemember that these limits apply only to redistribution of a reference\ndistribution, or to a true derivative work. If your project does not\ninclude this package or code based upon it, even if it requires this\npackage to function, it is not considered subject to this license or\nthese restrictions.\n* You must not charge a fee for purchase or rental of this package or\nany derivative work based on this package. It is still possible to\nuse this package in a commercial environment, however -- see What\nyou are permitted to do under this license.\n* You must not countermand or ignore, directly or otherwise, the\nrestrictions already extant in this package's license in your\nderivative work based on it. As a corollary, you must not place\nyour derivative work under a secondary license or description of\nterms that conflicts with it (for example, this license is not\ncompatible with the GNU Public License).\n* You must not label any modified distribution of this package as a\nreference or otherwise official distribution without the permission\nof the original Author or Authors. You must clearly specify that\nyour modified work is a derivative work, including binary-only\nreleases if the original included source code and you do not even\nif you did not modify the source prior to compilation.\n\nWhat you must do under this license\n\n* You must agree to all terms specified (agreement to which is\nunconditionally signified by your usage, modification or\nrepurposing of this package), or to remove the package from your\ncomputer and not use it further.\n* In the absence of any specific offer for redress or assistance\nunder warranty or guarantee of performance that the Author of this\npackage might make, you must agree to accept any and all liability\nthat may come from the use of this package, proper or improper,\nreal or imagined, and certify without condition that you use this\nproduct at your own risk with no guarantee of function,\nmerchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. If such offer\nof redress or assistance is extended, it is fulfillable only by the\nAuthor who extended the offer, which might not necessarily be this\nAuthor, nor might it be the Authors of any packages it might be\nbased upon.\n* If you choose to publicly redistribute this package or create a\nderivative work based on this package, you must make it available\nwithout any purchase or rental fee of any kind.\n* If you choose to create a derivative work based on this package,\nyour derivative work must be copyrighted, and must be governed\nunder (at a minimum) the original package's license, which will\nnecessarily include all terms noted here. As such, if you choose to\ndistribute your derivative work, you must include a human-readable\nlicense in your distribution containing all restrictions of use,\nnecessarily including this license, and any additional restrictions\nthe Author has mandated that do not contravene this license which\nyou and users of your derivative work must also honour.\n* If you choose to create and distribute a derivative work based on\nthis package, your derivative work must clearly make reference to\nthis package, any other packages your work or the original work\nmight be based on, and all applicable copyrights, either in your\ndocumentation, your work's standard human-readable output, or both.\nA suggested method might be\n\nContains or is based on the Foo software package.\nCopyright (C) 2112 D.
