DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS\n\n3.1.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\ndistributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\nof this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\ncopy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\ndistribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\nversion that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\nLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may\ninclude an additional document offering the additional rights\ndescribed in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\nmade available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\nvia an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\nyou made an Executable version available and to the Initial\nDeveloper; and if made available via Electronic Distribution\nMechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\nafter the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\nmonths after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\nhas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\nensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\nElectronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\nYou are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the\nModification and the location of the Source if a contact means is\nprovided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of the Source and may\nprovide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to\nbe made available.

If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your\nname as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to\nput such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\nstructure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as\na relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for\nsuch a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more\nrecipients of Covered Code.\n\nHowever, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\nthe Initial Developer or any Contributor.

The notice must be conspicuously\nincluded in any notice in an Executable version, related\ndocumentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights\nrelating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable\nversion of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may\ncontain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\ncompliance with the terms of this License and that the license for\nthe Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\nrecipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\nforth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\nunder a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any\nterms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not\nby the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\nindemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\nresult of any such terms You offer.\n\nIf you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you\nmust reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or\nother materials provided with the product.\n\n3.7.

APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached\nthe notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\nRed Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional\nproducts becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license\nsuch additional products on different terms from those contained in this\nLicense.\n\nRed Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red\nHat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may\nlicense Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in\nthis License.
