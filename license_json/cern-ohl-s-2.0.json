Version 2 of the CERN Open\nHardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and\ntwo reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and this\nlicence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).\n\nThe CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in\nunmodified form only.\n\nUse of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any\nLicensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in\ntheir development.\n\n\n1 Definitions\n\n1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-S.\n\n1.2 'Compatible Licence' means\n\na) any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or\n\nb) any version of the CERN-OHL-S, or\n\nc) any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which\nit applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S provided that on\nConveyance of any such Source, or any associated Product You\ntreat the Source in question as being licensed under\nCERN-OHL-S.\n\n1.3 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital\ncode which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to\nprepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its\nmedium or how it is expressed. It may include Notices.\n\n1.4 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available\nunder this Licence.\n\n1.5 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object,\nwhether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,\napplication or processing of Covered Source.\n\n1.6 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by\nmanufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered\nSource or another Product or otherwise.\n\n1.7 'Available Component' means any part, sub-assembly, library or\ncode which:\n\na) is licensed to You as Complete Source under a Compatible\nLicence; or\n\nb) is available, at the time a Product or the Source containing\nit is first Conveyed, to You and any other prospective\nlicensees\n\ni) as a physical part with sufficient rights and\ninformation (including any configuration and\nprogramming files and information about its\ncharacteristics and interfaces) to enable it either to\nbe Made itself, or to be sourced and used to Make the\nProduct; or\nii) as part of the normal distribution of a tool used to\ndesign or Make the Product.\n\n1.8 'Complete Source' means the set of all Source necessary to Make\na Product, in the preferred form for making modifications,\nincluding necessary installation and interfacing information\nboth for the Product, and for any included Available Components.\nIf the format is proprietary, it must also be made available in\na format (if the proprietary tool can create it) which is\nviewable with a tool available to potential licensees and\nlicensed under a licence approved by the Free Software\nFoundation or the Open Source Initiative. Complete Source need\nnot include the Source of any Available Component, provided that\nYou include in the Complete Source sufficient information to\nenable a recipient to Make or source and use the Available\nComponent to Make the Product.\n\n1.9 'Source Location' means a location where a Licensor has placed\nCovered Source, and which that Licensor reasonably believes will\nremain easily accessible for at least three years for anyone to\nobtain a digital copy.\n\n1.10 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,\nSource Location references, modification notices (subsection\n3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the\ndisclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered\nSource.\n\n1.11 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under\nthis Licence.\n\n1.12 'Licensor' means a natural or legal person who creates or\nmodifies Covered Source. A person may be a Licensee and a\nLicensor at the same time.\n\n1.13 'Convey' means to communicate to the public or distribute.\n\n\n2 Applicability\n\n2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying\nof Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By\nexercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably\naccept these terms and conditions.\n\n2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and\nshall apply worldwide and without limitation in time.\n\n2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the\nrights granted under this Licence to other Licensees.\n\n2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing,\nor any other similar right.\n\n\n3 Copying, modifying and Conveying Covered Source\n\n3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in\nany medium, provided You retain all Notices.\n\n3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices, provided that\nYou irrevocably undertake to make that modified Covered Source\navailable from a Source Location should You Convey a Product in\ncircumstances where the recipient does not otherwise receive a\ncopy of the modified Covered Source. In each case subsection 3.3\nshall apply.\n\nYou may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to\nthe corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may\nadd additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.\nIncluding Covered Source in a larger work is modifying the\nCovered Source, and the larger work becomes modified Covered\nSource.\n\n3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You\nshall also become a Licensor) provided that You:\n\na) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2;\n\nb) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You\nhave modified it, with the date and brief description of how\nYou have modified it;\n\nc) add a Source Location Notice for the modified Covered Source\nif You Convey in circumstances where the recipient does not\notherwise receive a copy of the modified Covered Source; and\n\nd) license the modified Covered Source under the terms and\nconditions of this Licence (or, as set out in subsection\n8.3, a later version, if permitted by the licence of the\noriginal Covered Source). Such modified Covered Source must\nbe licensed as a whole, but excluding Available Components\ncontained in it, which remain licensed under their own\napplicable licences.\n\n\n4 Making and Conveying Products\n\nYou may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either\nprovide each recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensure\nthat each recipient is notified of the Source Location of the Complete\nSource. That Complete Source is Covered Source, and You must\naccordingly satisfy Your obligations set out in subsection 3.3. If\nspecified in a Notice, the Product must visibly and securely display\nthe Source Location on it or its packaging or documentation in the\nmanner specified in that Notice.\n\n\n5 Research and Development\n\nYou may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to\na legal entity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance\nwork on Your behalf provided that the work is performed on terms which\nprevent the entity from both using the Source or Products for its own\ninternal purposes and Conveying the Source or Products or any\nmodifications to them to any person other than You. Any modifications\nmade by the entity shall be deemed to be made by You pursuant to\nsubsection 3.2.\n\n\n6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY\n\n6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products\nare provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties,\nincluding, but not limited to, implied warranties of\nmerchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of\nthird party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use\nare disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the\nmaximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no\nrepresentation that any Source or Product does not or will not\ninfringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other\nproprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and\nperformance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not\nthe Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part\nof this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights\ngranted under this Licence.\n\n6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to\nthe maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for\ndirect, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,\npunitive or other damages of any character including, without\nlimitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of\nuse, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused\nand on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including\nnegligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way\nin relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source\nand/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of\nthe possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the\nLicensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,\ndamages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,\nin relation to such use.\n\n\n7 Patents\n\n7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each\nLicensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as\nstated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4) patent license to Make, have\nMade, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer\nthe Covered Source and Products, where such licence applies only\nto those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are\nnecessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered\nSource as Conveyed by that Licensor.\n\n7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including\na cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nCovered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory\npatent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent\nlicensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable\nthen any rights granted to You under this Licence shall\nterminate as of the date such process is initiated.\n\n\n8 General\n\n8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become\ninvalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining\nprovisions shall remain effective.\n\n8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and\nabbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is\nknown, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where\nthe use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use\nshall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind\nof endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or\nits personnel.\n\n8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence\nwhich it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns. New\nversions will be published with a unique version number and a\nvariant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has\nspecified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source\nwithout specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source\nas being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that\nvariant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be\ntreated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may\nalso specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific\nversion of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You\nmay apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same\nvariant identifier published by CERN.\n\n8.4 This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail\nto comply with any of its terms and conditions.\n\n8.5 However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your\nLicence from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has\nterminated this Licence by giving You, while You remain in\nbreach, a notice specifying the breach and requiring You to cure\nit within 30 days, and You have failed to come into compliance\nin all material respects by the end of the 30 day period. Should\nYou repeat the breach after receipt of a cure notice and\nsubsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate\nimmediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply\nafter any termination.\n\n8.6 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor\nacting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are\nspecifically excluded."
