    "license_body": "Server Side Public License\nVERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018\n\nCopyright © 2018 MongoDB, Inc.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n“This License” refers to Server Side Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and\n“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in\na fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the\nearlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\nthe Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a\ncomputer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the\nextent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that\n(1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that\nthere is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties\nare provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and\nhow to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of\nuser commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list\nmeets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a\nwork.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is\nwidely used among developers working in that language.  The “System\nLibraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as\na whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\nComponent, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves\nonly to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement\na Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the\npublic in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a\nmajor essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the\nspecific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or\na compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used\nto run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the\nsource code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run\nthe object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control\nthose activities. However, it does not include the work's System\nLibraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs\nwhich are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are\nnot part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes\ninterface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\nthe source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms\nthat the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate\ndata communication or control flow between those subprograms and other\nparts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program, subject to section 13. The\noutput from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the\noutput, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License\nacknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by\ncopyright law.  Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate\ncovered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your\nlicense otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to\nothers for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively\nfor you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided\nthat you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all\nmaterial for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or\nrunning the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your\nbehalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them\nfrom making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their\nrelationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it\nunnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11\nof the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws\nprohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is\neffected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the\ncovered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,\nyour or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep\nintact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms\nadded in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices\nof the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this\nLicense along with the Program.  You may charge any price or no price for\neach copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty\nprotection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms\nof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,\nand giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released\nunder this License and any conditions added under section 7. This\nrequirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all\nnotices”.\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\nanyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore\napply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the\nwhole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are\npackaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any\nother way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\nseparately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work\nneed not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and\nwhich are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on\na volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if\nthe compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the\naccess or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the\nindividual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does\nnot cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily\nused for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written\noffer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you\noffer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give\nanyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the\nCorresponding Source for all the software in the product that is\ncovered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\nfor software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost\nof physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to\ncopy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is\nallowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received\nthe object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\n(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy\nthe object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on\na different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\nequivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions\nnext to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.\nRegardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain\nobligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\nsatisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\ninform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of\nthe work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\nsubsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\nin conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part\nof a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User\nProduct is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term\n(regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding\nSource conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the\nInstallation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither\nyou nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object\ncode on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in\nROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access\nto a network may be denied when the modification itself materially\nand adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the\nrules and protocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in\naccord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\n(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),\nand must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or\ncopying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be\ntreated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that\nthey are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only\nto part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those\npermissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License\nwithout regard to the additional permissions.  When you convey a copy of\na covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions\nfrom that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be\nwritten to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the\nwork.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to\na covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright\npermission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add\nto a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\nnames, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material\nby anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with\ncontractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any\nliability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those\nlicensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further\nrestrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,\nyou may remove that term. If a license document contains a further\nrestriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you\nmay add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license\ndocument, provided that the further restriction does not survive such\nrelicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must\nplace, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms\nthat apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the\napplicable terms.  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be\nstated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as\nexceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify\nit is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\nof section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates\nyour license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to\nnotify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\nafter the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\npermanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some\nreasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\nviolation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and\nyou cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a\ncopy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring\nsolely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a\ncopy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than\nthis License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered\nwork. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your\nacceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives\na license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that\nwork, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work\nresults from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who\nreceives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\nthe party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous\nparagraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the\nwork from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can\nget it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights\ngranted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a\nlicense fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted\nunder this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim\nis infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing\nthe Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work\nthus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or\ncontrolled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter\nacquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this\nLicense, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not\ninclude claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further\nmodification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n“control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,\nuse, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate\nthe contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party\nmeans to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\nagainst the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and\nthe Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,\nfree of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly\navailable network server or other readily accessible means, then you must\neither (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\narrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this\nparticular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the\nrequirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\nrecipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but\nfor the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or\nyour recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe\none or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason\nto believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving\nthe covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a\nspecific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is\nautomatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works\nbased on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are\na party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of\ndistributing software, under which you make payment to the third party\nbased on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under\nwhich the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the\ncovered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection\nwith copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from\nthose copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\nproducts or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you\nentered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior\nto 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\nimplied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be\navailable to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot use,\npropagate or convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then\nas a consequence you may not use, propagate or convey it at all. For\nexample, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for\nfurther conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way\nyou could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain\nentirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Offering the Program as a Service.\n\nIf you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version\navailable to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source\nCode available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the\nterms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or\nmodified version available to third parties as a service includes,\nwithout limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the\nfunctionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a\ncomputer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or\nprimarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or\noffering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the\nProgram or modified version.\n\n“Service Source Code” means the Corresponding Source for the Program or\nthe modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that\nyou use to make the Program or modified version available as a service,\nincluding, without limitation, management software, user interfaces,\napplication program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software,\nbackup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a\nuser could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code\nyou make available.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nMongoDB, Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Server Side\nPublic License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new\nproblems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the Server Side Public\nLicense “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of\nany later version published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not\nspecify a version number of the Server Side Public License, you may\nchoose any version ever published by MongoDB, Inc.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of\nthe Server Side Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement\nof acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\nversion for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions.\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder\nas a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\nAND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING\nANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\nTHE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\nLOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\nOR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above\ncannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing\ncourts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\nwaiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a\nwarranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in\nreturn for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
