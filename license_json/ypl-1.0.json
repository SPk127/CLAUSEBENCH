Inc., a Delaware corporation having its\nprincipal place of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089\n(\"Yahoo!\") will provide software to you via download or otherwise (\"Software\").\nBy using the Software, you, an individual or an entity (\"You\") agree to the\nterms of this Agreement.\n\nIn consideration of the mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set\nforth below, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1. Grant of Copyright License\n\n* 1.1 - Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo!\nhereby grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in\nand to the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable\nlicense to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software\nand Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,\naddition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a\n\"Modification;\" however, any file You add to the Software that does\nnot contain any part of the Software is not a \"Modification.\"\n\n* 1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or\nother entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject\nto Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to\nthis Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or\nentity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n* 1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source\ncode format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement,\nand You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your\ndistribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in\nsource code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in\nthe same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software.\nIn other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this\nAgreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo! in terms of the rights\nYou grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the\nlicensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when\nYou \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo!, You are not subject to the\njurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes\nunder this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or\nstate courts of northern California.\n\n* 1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in\ncompiled or object code format, You must also provide recipients with\naccess to the Software or Modification in source code format along\nwith a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution of the\nSoftware or Modifications in compiled or object code format may be\nunder a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance\nwith the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make\nabsolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or\nModification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone\nand not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not restrict recipients\nfrom exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by\nYahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any\nModification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.\n\n* 1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files\nthat are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any\nportion of the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You\nchoose.\n\n2. Support\n\n* Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to\nYou. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any\nlicense with You for any other edition of the Software.\n\n3. Intellectual Property Rights\n\n* 3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in\nSection 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may\narise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication,\nexhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all\nintellectual property rights, that are not expressly granted under\nthis Agreement are hereby reserved.\n\n* 3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any Modification you create,\nYou must retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent,\ntrademark, and attribution notices that are included in the Software\nin the same form as they appear in the Software. This includes the\npreservation of attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos\nthat exist within a user interface of the Software.\n\n* 3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use any party's\nname, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with\nSection 3.2.\n\n4.

MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY\nREGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT\nWARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN\nUNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO!\nSPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF\nSUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY\nMODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE FOREGOING.\n\n5. Limitation of Liability\n\n* IN NO EVENT WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND\n(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS\nINTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR\nARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF\nTHE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS\nA BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND\nEVEN IF YAHOO! HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n6. Term and Termination\n\n* 6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until\nterminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.\n\n* 6.2 - In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this\nAgreement, Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.\n\n* 6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate upon the\ntermination of this Agreement. Termination will be in addition to any\nrights and remedies available to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this\nAgreement.\n\n* 6.4 - Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions\nregarding reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming\nor limiting Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination\n(Section 6) or Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will\nsurvive termination of this Agreement.\n\n7. Miscellaneous\n\n* This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with\nrespect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all\nprevious communications, representations, understandings and\nagreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect\nto said subject matter. The relationship of the parties hereunder is\nthat of independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be\nconstrued as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any\nother form of legal association between the parties. If any term,\ncondition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid,\nunlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be\nconstrued in a manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this\nAgreement. Such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed\nfrom the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will\ncontinue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted\nby law. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance\nwith the laws of the State of California and the United States of\nAmerica, without regard to conflict of law principles. The U.N.\nConvention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not\napply to this Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement\ninvolving Yahoo! or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the\njurisdiction of the federal or state courts of northern California,\nwith venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be\nassigned, no obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not\nbe transferred by You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by\noperation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or\nconsolidation, without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any\npurported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent\nshall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this\nAgreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must\nbe in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to\nenforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at\nany time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such\nparty's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the\nvalidity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such\nparty's right to take subsequent action."
