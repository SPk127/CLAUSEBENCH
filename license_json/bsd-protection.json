For programmers whose primary\nintention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is\narguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it\npermits improvements to be used wherever they will help, without\nidealogical or metallic constraint.\n\nThis is of particular value to those who produce reference\nimplementations of proposed standards: The case of TCP/IP clearly\nillustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads\nthe rapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a\nde jure standard (eg, OSI network models).\n\nWith the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General\nPublic License, however, the continued success of this role is called\ninto question.  Given that the inclusion of a few lines of \"GPL-tainted\"\nwork into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution\n-- and given that further work will likely build upon the \"tainted\"\nportions, making them difficult to remove at a future date -- there are\ninevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to protect their\ngoal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard\nagainst such \"GPL-taint\".\n\nIn addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing\nand selling (possibly closed-source) code would wish to protect\nthemselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.  While under\nexisting licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any\nform of open license, if a license existed under which they could\nincorporate any improvements back into their own (commercial) products\nthen they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.\n\nFor the above reasons, we put forth this \"BSD Protection License\": A\nlicense designed to retain the freedom granted by the BSD license to use\nlicensed works in a wide variety of settings, both non-commercial and\ncommercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors\nrestrict that freedom.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and\nmodification follow.\n\nBSD PROTECTION LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0. Definitions.\na) \"Program\", below, refers to any program or work distributed under\nthe terms of this license.\nb) A \"work based on the Program\", below, refers to either the Program\nor any derivative work under copyright law.\nc) \"Modification\", below, refers to the act of creating derivative\nworks.\nd) \"You\", below, refers to each licensee.\n\n1. Scope.\nThis license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of\nthe Program.  Other activities are outside the scope of this\nlicense; The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the\noutput from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\nwork based on the Program.\n\n2. Verbatim copies.\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\nabsence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n3. Modification and redistribution under closed license.\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute\nthe resulting derivative works, provided that you meet the\nfollowing conditions:\na) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be\nreproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or\nother materials provided in a manner in which such notices are\nnormally distributed.\nb) The derivative work must be clearly identified as such, in order\nthat it may not be confused with the original work.\nc) The license under which the derivative work is distributed must\nexpressly prohibit the distribution of further derivative works.\n\n4. Modification and redistribution under open license.\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute\nthe resulting derivative works, provided that you meet the\nfollowing conditions:\na) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be\nreproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or\nother materials provided in a manner in which such notices are\nnormally distributed.\nb) You must clearly indicate the nature and date of any changes made\nto the Program.  The full details need not necessarily be\nincluded in the individual modified files, provided that each\nmodified file is clearly marked as such and instructions are\nincluded on where the full details of the modifications may be\nfound.\nc) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\n5. Implied acceptance.\nYou may not copy or distribute the Program or any derivative works\nexcept as expressly provided under this license.  Consequently, any\nsuch action will be taken as implied acceptance of the terms of this\nlicense.\n\n6.
