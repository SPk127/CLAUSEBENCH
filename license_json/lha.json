Distribution shall conform:\na. The content of redistribution (i.e., source code, documentation,\nand reference guide for programmers) shall include original contents.\nIf contents are modified, the document clearly indicating\nthe fact of modification must be included.\nb. If LHa is redistributed with added values, you must put your best\neffort to include them (Translator comment: If read literally,\noriginal Japanese was unclear what \"them\" means here.  But\nundoubtedly this \"them\" means source code for the added value\nportion and this is a typical Japanese sloppy writing style to\nabbreviate as such)  Also the document clearly indicating that\nadded value was added must be included.\nc. Binary only distribution is not allowed (including added value\nones.)\n3. You need to put effort to distribute the latest version (This is not\nyour duty).\nNB: Distribution on Internet is free.  Please notify me by e-mail or\nother means prior to the distribution if distribution is done through\nnon-Internet media (Magazine, CDROM etc.)  If not, make sure to Email\nme later.\n4. Any damage caused by the existence and use of this program will not\nbe compensated.\n5. Author will not be responsible to correct errors even if program is\ndefective.\n6. This program, either as a part of this or as a whole of this, may be\nincluded into other programs.  In this case, that program is not LHa\nand can not call itself LHa.\n7. For commercial use, in addition to above conditions, following\ncondition needs to be met.\na.  The program whose content is mainly this program can not be used\ncommercially.\nb.  If the recipient of commercial use deems inappropriate as a\nprogram user, you must not distribute.\nc.  If used as a method for the installation, you must not force\nothers to use this program.  In this case, commercial user will\nperform its work while taking full responsibility of its outcome.\nd.  If added value is done under the commercial use by using this\nprogram, commercial user shall provide its support.\n(Osamu Aoki also comments:\nHere \"commercial\" may be interpreted as \"for-fee\".  \"Added value\" seems\nto mean \"feature enhancement\".  )\nTranslated License Statement by Tsugio Okamoto (translated by\nGOTO Masanori <gotom@debian.org>):\nIt's free to distribute on the network, but if you distribute for\nthe people who cannot access the network (by magazine or CD-ROM),\nplease send E-Mail (Inter-Net address) to the author before the\ndistribution. That's well where this software is appeard.\nIf you cannot do, you must send me the E-Mail later.`"
