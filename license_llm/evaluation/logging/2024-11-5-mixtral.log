The `section` field is added for context and clarity.\n\nI can generate similar JSON objects for the other sections as well. Here are some examples:\n```json\n{\n  \"marker\": \"MUST\",\n  \"section\": \"13.4 Severability (a)\",\n  \"obligation\": \"If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"marker\": \"CAN\",\n  \"section\": \"13.5 Dispute Resolution\",\n  \"permission\": \"Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License.\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"marker\": \"NOT SPECIFIED\",\n  \"section\": \"13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law\",\n  \"note\": \"This section does not impose any obligation or permission, but rather states that this License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and specifies the governing law.\"\n}\n```\nNote that in the last example, I included a `note` field instead of an `obligation` or `permission` field, since the section does not impose any obligation or permission but merely provides context.\n\nI hope this helps!

For example, the text states that the license is perpetual, so the marker value for \"accuracy\" is set to \"NOT SPECIFIED\". The text also mentions that Licensor can release the Work under different license terms or stop distributing the Work at any time, which is why the marker value for \"termination\" is set to \"NOT SPECIFIED\".\n\nRegarding the miscellaneous license terms, the text states that each time the Work or a Collective Work is distributed, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. This indicates that the marker value for distributing the Work or a Collective Work should be \"MUST\". Similarly, the text states that each time a Derivative Work is distributed, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. This indicates that the marker value for distributing a Derivative Work should also be \"MUST\".\n\nThe text also states that no term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived unless such waiver is in writing, which means that waiver and consent must be in writing, so the marker value for that key is set to \"NOT SPECIFIED\". The text also specifies that Creative Commons makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work, and Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever. This indicates that Creative Commons has a limited role and should not use the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo without prior written consent. Therefore, the marker value for the key \"creative_commons_role\" is set to \"MUST NOT\"."}

Also, Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License, which means that they are optional and can be applied even after the termination of the license.\n- In section 8, each time the user distributes or publicly digitally performs the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. Also, if any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

For Section 4 (Restrictions on Open Downstream Distributions) under both options (a) and (b):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"marker\": \"MUST NOT\"\n}\n```\n\nBoth options in this section forbid making any downstream distribution that does not comply with the licensing requirements, either by requiring direct licensing from The Frameworx Company or sub-licensing all rights and obligations to the distributee.\n\n3. For the first sentence in Section 5 (Intellectual Property):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"marker\": \"NOT SPECIFIED\"\n}\n```\n\nThis section does not specify any marker since it only states that this license agreement preserves and respects the intellectual property rights of both parties, without explicitly requiring or forbidding any actions.\n\n4. For Section 6 (Warranty Disclaimer):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"marker\": \"NOT SPECIFIED\"\n}\n```\n\nThis section does not specify any marker since it only disclaims any implied warranties and limits the liability of the licensor, without explicitly requiring or forbidding any actions.\n\n5.

This is a MUST requirement.\n* `downstream_distribution_licensing_options`: You have two options for licensing Downstream Distributions: (a) requiring each distributee under the relevant Downstream Distribution to obtain a direct license from The Frameworx Company, or (b) sub-licensing all your rights and obligations hereunder to that distributee, including your obligation to require distributees to be bound by license restrictions as contemplated by this Section 4 (Section 4).\n* `right_to_sublicense`: You have the right to sublicense your rights hereunder as necessary to fully effect the intent and purpose of this Section 4, but this does not affect any of your rights and obligations under this License Agreement. The Frameworx Company also retains all rights to take appropriate action against any sub-licensee to ensure their full compliance with the intent and purposes of this License Agreement (Section 4).\n* `intellectual_property_preservation`: This License Agreement preserves and respects Your and The Frameworx Company's respective intellectual property rights, including copyrights and patent rights relating to the Frameworx Code Base (Section 5).

This means that there is NO WARRANTY associated with the software.\n* `license_violation_consequences`: If you violate the provisions of this License Agreement, the license and all your rights thereunder shall be deemed automatically terminated and void as of any Downstream Distribution directly or indirectly made or facilitated by You that violates the provisions of this License Agreement (Section 7).

This implies that any claim or damage arising from the utilization of rights under this License is the responsibility of the party using the rights, and not the Initial Developer or Contributors. Therefore, a user must accept this limitation of liability and agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.\n\nHowever, this limitation does not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence, if applicable law prohibits such limitation. Also, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to the user.\n\nTherefore, a user must be aware of and accept these terms before using the software. If they cannot accept these terms, they must not use the software."}

The `consistent` key has a nested array of regulation names that the acquisition must be consistent with.\n\nNote that I've added a `marker` property to each key-value pair to indicate whether it represents something that is mandatory (e.g. \"MUST\"), prohibited (e.g. \"MUST NOT\"), optional (e.g. \"CAN\"), or not specified (e.g. \"NOT SPECIFIED\").

Therefore, we can't determine a mandatory or optional requirement for using an account in this context.\n```json\n{\n  \"marker\": \"NOT SPECIFIED\"\n}\n```\n\n2.

Here's why: The text clearly states that \"All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland.
