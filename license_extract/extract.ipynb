sure that you have the freedom to\\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\\ndo these things. \\n\\nThese restrictions\\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\\nsoftware, or if you modify it. \\n\\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \\n\\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or\\nmodify the software. \\n\\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\\nfollow. \\n\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\\n\\n0. \\n\\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\\nthis Affero General Public License. \\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\\nthis License; they are outside its scope. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\\nalong with the Program. \\n\\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\\nthese conditions:\\n\\n* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\\nyou changed the files and the date of any change. \\n\\n* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\\npart contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed\\nas a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \\n\\n* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\\nmust cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\\nordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\\ncopyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\\nyou provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\\nconditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. \\n\\nIf identifiable\\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\\nworks. \\n\\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\\nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \\n\\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\\nProgram. \\n\\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\\nLicense. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section\\n2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\\nprovided that you also do one of the following:\\n\\n* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\\nwhich must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\\n\\n* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give\\nany third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\\nsource distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\\nsource code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or,\\n\\n* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\\ndistribute corresponding source code. \\n\\n(This alternative is allowed only for\\nnoncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\\nor executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above. \\n\\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed\\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\\naccompanies the executable. \\n\\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent

freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things. \\n\\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\\nand/or modify the software. \\n\\nA secondary benefit of defending all users\\' freedom is that\\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\\nincorporate. \\n\\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow. \\n\\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\\nexact copy. \\n\\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. \\n\\nPropagation includes copying,\\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well. \\n\\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\\nfor making modifications to it. \\n\\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\\ncontrol those activities. \\n\\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\\nnot control copyright. \\n\\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\\'s\\nusers, your or third parties\\' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\\ntechnological measures. \\n\\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\\nit, and giving a relevant date. \\n\\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\\nin one of these ways:\\n\\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\\ncustomarily used for software interchange. \\n\\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge. \\n\\nThis\\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\\nwith subsection 6b. \\n\\nThe information must\\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\\nmodification has been made. \\n\\nAccess to a\\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\\nprotocols for communication across the network. \\n\\n(Additional permissions may be written to require their own\\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work. \\n\\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\\nprovided under this License. \\n\\nAny attempt otherwise to propagate or\\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\\nparagraph of section 11). \\n\\nHowever,\\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\\nmodify any covered work. \\n\\nTherefore, by modifying or propagating a\\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. \\n\\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\\npropagate that work, subject to this License. \\n\\nA contributor\\'s \"essential patent claims\" are all patent

worldwide, royalty-free\\npatent license under the contributor\\'s essential patent claims, to\\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\\npropagate the contents of its contributor version. \\n\\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\\nwork and works based on it. \\n\\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\\nmeans of facilitating copying of software. \\n\\nEND OF TERMS AND

DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK. \\n\\nA Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in Executable form (an \"EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION\") to any third party,

conditions is fulfilled:\\n\\n(a) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or\\n\\n(b) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months. \\n\\nFor greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form, whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work or Independent Modules, or in some other combination. \\n\\nSOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS. \\n\\n3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in any Source Code form. \\n\\nA Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution. \\n\\nNO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS. \\n\\nThe Recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such internal use, except where required below in this Section 3. \\n\\nAll Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. \\n\\nIf the Recipient chooses to distribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the terms of Sections 3. \\n\\nAny Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. \\n\\nDESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS. \\n\\n(b) The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the \"EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") for documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the \"NEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") for documenting such changes. \\n\\n8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in Part 1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the Initial Work distributed under this License. \\n\\n(c) Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as expressly set out in this License. \\n\\n1 does not diminish any of the other terms of this License, including without limitation the obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable distribution (as the case may be)). \\n\\nTherefore, if a Distributor includes the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services, such Distributor (\"COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an \"INDEMNIFIED PARTY\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"LOSSES\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. \\n\\nHowever, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor, then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction,

introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the \"EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") for documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the \"NEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") for documenting such changes. \\n\\n(d) For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. \\n\\nFurther, a Recipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1 of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. \\n\\nPart 1 of any Supplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting

Distribution (\"BSD\") license has proven very effective\\nover the years at allowing for a wide spread of work throughout both\\ncommercial and non-commercial products. \\n\\nGiven that the inclusion of a few lines of \"GPL-tainted\"\\nwork into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution\\n-- and given that further work will likely build upon the \"tainted\"\\nportions, making them difficult to remove at a future date -- there are\\ninevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to protect their\\ngoal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard\\nagainst such \"GPL-taint\". \\n\\nWhile under\\nexisting licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any\\nform of open license, if a license existed under which they could\\nincorporate any improvements back into their own (commercial) products\\nthen they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution. \\n\\nThe precise terms and conditions for

patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\\ncountries not thus excluded. \\n\\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\\nprograms whose distribution conditions are

AND MODIFICATION\\n\\n0. \\n\\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library which\\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\\nGeneral Public License (also called \"this License\"). \\n\\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. \\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\\'s\\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\\nLibrary. \\n\\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\na) The modified work must itself be a software library. \\n\\nIf\\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. \\n\\nBut when you\\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\\nit. \\n\\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\\ncollective works based on the Library. \\n\\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\\nthe scope of this License. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\\nmedium customarily used for software interchange. \\n\\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code. \\n\\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \\n\\n)\\n\\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. \\n\\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\\nmodification of the work for the customer\\'s own use and reverse\\nengineering for debugging such modifications. \\n\\nAlso, you must do one\\nof these things:\\n\\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\\nchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\\nwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\\nuses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\\nexecutable containing the modified Library. \\n\\n)\\n\\nb) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\\nleast three years, to give the same user the materials\\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\\nthan the cost of performing this distribution. \\n\\nc) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\\nfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\\nspecified materials from the same place. \\n\\nHowever, as a special exception,\\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\\nthe executable. \\n\\nSuch a contradiction means you cannot\\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\\ndistribute. \\n\\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\\n\\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\\nfacilities. \\n\\nThis must be distributed under the terms of the\\nSections above. \\n\\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License. \\n\\nAny\\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\\nrights under this License. \\n\\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. \\n\\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\\nsubject to these terms and conditions. \\n\\nIf you cannot\\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\\nmay not distribute the Library at all. \\n\\nFor example, if a patent\\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \\n\\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\\nimplemented by public license practices. \\n\\nMany people have made\\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\\nimpose that choice. \\n\\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\\nexcluded. \\n\\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\\nwrite to the author to ask for permission. \\n\\nOur\\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\\nand reuse of software generally. \\n\\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR

Libraries\\n\\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\\neveryone can redistribute and change.

which gives you legal\\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \\n\\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\\nprogram and simply using it. \\n\\nThis Library General Public License is intended to\\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\\nlibraries that are incorporated in them. \\n\\n(We have not seen how to achieve\\nthis as regards changes in header

\\n\\n(Hereinafter, translation is\\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\". \\n\\n)\\n\\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\\nmaking modifications to it. \\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. \\n\\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\\nfee. \\n\\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\na) The modified work must itself be a software library. \\n\\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. \\n\\nTo do\\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\\ninstead of to this License. \\n\\n)  Do not make any other change in\\nthese notices. \\n\\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\\nmedium customarily used for software interchange. \\n\\nSuch a\\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License. \\n\\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. \\n\\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\\nunder terms of your

distribute\\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License. \\n\\nAny\\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\\ndistribute the Library is void, and will

designed to take away your\\nfreedom to share and change it. \\n\\nBy contrast, the GNU General Public\\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. \\n\\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. \\n\\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. \\n\\nIf you link a program with the library, you must provide\\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\\nit. \\n\\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \\n\\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\\nprogram and simply using it. \\n\\nThis Library General Public License is intended to\\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\\nlibraries that are incorporated in them. \\n\\n(We have not seen how to achieve\\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library. \\n\\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow. \\n\\nGNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\\n\\n0. \\n\\nA \"work based on the\\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\\nstraightforwardly into another language. \\n\\n(Hereinafter, translation is\\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\". \\n\\n)\\n\\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\\nmaking modifications to it. \\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. \\n\\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\\nfee. \\n\\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\na) The modified work must itself be a software library. \\n\\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change. \\n\\nTo do\\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\\ninstead of to this License. \\n\\n)  Do not make any other change in\\nthese notices. \\n\\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\\nmedium customarily used for software interchange. \\n\\nSuch a\\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License. \\n\\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. \\n\\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\\nmodification of the work for the customer\\'s own use and reverse\\nengineering for debugging such modifications. \\n\\nAlso, you must do one\\nof these things:\\n\\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\\nchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\\nwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\\nuses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\\nexecutable containing the modified Library. \\n\\n(It is understood\\nthat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\\nLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\\nto use the modified definitions. \\n\\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License. \\n\\nAny\\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\\nrights under this License. \\n\\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. \\n\\nTherefore, by\\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\\nthe Library or works based on it. \\n\\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\\nsubject to these terms and conditions. \\n\\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\\nWRITING WILL

this license, which gives you legal\\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \\n\\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow. \\n\\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\\n\\n0. \\n\\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other\\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). \\n\\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. \\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library\\'s\\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\\nLibrary. \\n\\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\\n\\na) The modified work must itself be a software library. \\n\\nIf\\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. \\n\\nBut when you\\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\\nit. \\n\\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\\ncollective works based on the Library. \\n\\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\\nthe scope of this License. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\\nmedium customarily used for software interchange. \\n\\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code. \\n\\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \\n\\n)\\n\\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. \\n\\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\\nmodification of the work for the customer\\'s own use and reverse\\nengineering for debugging such modifications. \\n\\nAlso, you must do one\\nof these things:\\n\\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\\nchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\\nwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\\nuses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\\nexecutable containing the modified Library. \\n\\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\\nleast three years, to give the same user the materials\\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\\nthan the cost of performing this distribution. \\n\\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\\nfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\\nspecified materials from the same place. \\n\\nHowever, as a special exception,\\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\\nthe executable. \\n\\nSuch a contradiction means you cannot\\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\\ndistribute. \\n\\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\\n\\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\\nfacilities. \\n\\nThis must be distributed under the terms of the\\nSections above. \\n\\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License. \\n\\nAny\\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\\nrights under this License. \\n\\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. \\n\\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\\nsubject to these terms and conditions. \\n\\nIf you cannot\\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\\nmay not distribute the Library at all. \\n\\nFor example, if a patent\\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \\n\\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\\nimplemented by public license practices. \\n\\nMany people have made\\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\\nimpose that choice. \\n\\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\\nexcluded. \\n\\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\\nwrite to the author to ask for permission. \\n\\nOur\\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\\nand reuse of software generally. \\n\\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING

Linguistic Resource which contains\\na notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it\\nmay be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License for\\nLinguistic Resources (also called \"this License\"). \\n\\nThe \"Linguistic Resource\", below, refers to any such work which has been\\ndistributed under these terms. \\n\\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\\nthis License; they are outside its scope. \\n\\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Linguistic Resource as you\\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Linguistic Resource. \\n\\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion\\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute\\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\\nalso meet all of these conditions:\\n\\na) The modified work must itself be a linguistic resource. \\n\\nIf identifiable sections\\nof that work are not derived from the Linguistic Resource, and can be reasonably\\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\\nworks. \\n\\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work\\nbased on the Linguistic Resource, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\\nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \\n\\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to\\nwork written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control\\nthe distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Linguistic Resource. \\n\\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Linguistic Resource\\nwith the Linguistic Resource (or with a work based on the Linguistic Resource) on a\\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\\nscope of this License. \\n\\nIf\\nthe package is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource, you may distribute the\\npackage under the terms of Section 4. \\n\\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine a \"work that uses\\nthe Linguistic Resource\" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the\\nLinguistic Resource) to produce a package containing portions of the Linguistic\\nResource, and distribute that package under terms of your choice, provided that\\nthe terms permit modification of the package for the customer\\'s own use and reverse\\nengineering for debugging such modifications. \\n\\nAlso, you must do one of these things:\\n\\na) Accompany the package with the complete corresponding machine-readable\\nlegible form of the Linguistic Resource including whatever changes were used\\nin the package (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and,\\nif the package contains an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, with the\\ncomplete machine-readable \"work that uses the Linguistic Resource\", as object\\ncode and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Linguistic Resource\\nand then encrypt it to produce a modified package containing the modified\\nLinguistic Resource. \\n\\nc) Accompany the package with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\\nto give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 4a, above, for a\\ncharge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \\n\\nd) If distribution of the package is made by offering access to copy from a\\ndesignated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials\\nfrom the same place. \\n\\nHowever, as a special exception,\\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed\\n(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\\naccompanies the executable. \\n\\nSuch a contradiction means\\nyou cannot use both them and the Linguistic Resource together in a package that you distribute. \\n\\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource\\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. \\n\\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\\nsublicense, link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will automatically\\nterminate your rights under this License. \\n\\nHowever, nothing\\nelse grants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource or its derivative\\nworks. \\n\\nEach time you redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic\\nResource), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\\ndistribute, link with or modify the Linguistic Resource subject to these terms and conditions. \\n\\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then\\nas a consequence you may not distribute the Linguistic Resource at all. \\n\\nFor example, if a\\npatent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic Resource by\\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could\\nsatisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\\nLinguistic Resource. \\n\\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property\\nright claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of\\nprotecting the integrity of the free resource distribution system which is implemented by public\\nlicense practices. \\n\\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of data\\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up\\nto the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute resources through any other\\nsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \\n\\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic Resource is restricted in certain countries\\neither by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the\\nLinguistic Resource under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\\nexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not\\nthus excluded. \\n\\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Linguistic Resource into other free programs whose\\ndistribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. \\n\\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT\\nHOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE AS\\nPERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE\\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES

file should have restrictions on\\ndistribution other than those specified below. \\n\\nThis is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete\\nunmodified copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this\\nfile, and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra\\nrestrictions. \\n\\nIf you do need to modify the distribution terms of some\\nfiles, do not refer to this license, instead distribute The Program\\nunder a different license. \\n\\nYou may use the parts of the text of LPPL as\\na model for your own license, but your license should not directly

particular this means that The Program has to be distributed\\nincluding its documentation if documentation was part of the original\\ndistribution. \\n\\nThe distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file\\nlisting all the files covered by this license. \\n\\nIf you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!\\n\\nThe distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the\\nThe Program, and the reuse of code from The Program, are allowed\\nunder the following restrictions:\\n\\n* It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not\\nexpressly forbid it. \\n\\nAny such changed\\nfiles must be distributed under a license that forbids distribution\\nof those files, and any files derived from them, under the names used\\nby the original files in the distribution of The Program. \\n\\n* You also distribute the unmodified version of the file or\\nalternatively provide sufficient information so that the\\nuser of your modified file can be reasonably expected to be\\nable to obtain an original, unmodified copy of The Program. \\n\\nHowever, modified files are not\\nallowed to be distributed in place of original files. \\n\\ntex in the base LaTeX\\ndistribution describes when it makes sense to modify or generate\\nsuch files. \\n\\ntex\\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions. \\n\\nBecause of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems\\nlike LaTeX, The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of\\nnon-standard versions of components of LaTeX or of generally available\\ncontributed code for them but such distributions are permitted under the\\nabove restrictions. \\n\\ntex in the base LaTeX distribution details\\nthe reasons for the legal requirements detailed above. \\n\\ntex may still apply, and should be read before\\na modified version of The Program is distributed. \\n\\nConditions on individual files\\n==============================\\nThe individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede\\nthe general conditions on distribution and modification contained in\\nthis file. \\n\\nIf there are any such files, the distribution of The\\nProgram will contain a prominent file that lists all the exceptional\\nfiles. \\n\\n* The conditions on *distribution* are the same for all the files. \\n\\nThus a (re)distributor of a complete, unchanged copy of The

names used\\nby the original files in the distribution of The Program. \\n\\n* You change any `identification string' in The Program to clearly\\nindicate that the file is not part of the standard system. \\n\\n* If The Program includes an `error report address' so that errors\\nmay be reported to The Copyright Holder, or other specified\\naddresses, this address must be changed in any modified

met:\\n\\n1. \\n\\nYou must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the\\ndistribution of a modified version of the file as described below\\nin the subsection `Additional Conditions on

conditions for\\ndistributing the modified file. \\n\\nWhile you might intend that such\\nmodified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by\\naccident -- you may forget that you have

the file. \\n\\nThe conditions\\non individual files of The Program therefore may differ only with\\nrespect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that\\nis allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions\\nof those files. \\n\\nAdditional Conditions on LaTeX Software Files\\n---------------------------------------------\\nIf a file of The Program is intended to be used with LaTeX (that is,\\nif it is a LaTeX software file), then the following additional\\nconditions, which supplement and/or supersede the conditions\\nabove, apply to the file according to its filename extension:\\n\\n- You may not modify any file with filename extension `. \\n\\nYou may also distribute\\nsuch modified LaTeX font definition files with their original names\\nprovided that:\\n(1) the only changes to the original files either enable use of\\navailable fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts;\\n(2) you also distribute the original, unmodified files (TeX input\\npaths can be used to control which set of LaTeX font definition\\nfiles is actually used by TeX). \\n\\nBecause of portability and exchangeability issues in LaTeX software,\\nThe LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of\\ncomponents of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them,\\nbut such distribution can meet the conditions of this license. \\n\\nIn no event unless agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or\\nany author named in the files of The Program, or any other party who may\\ndistribute and/or modify The Program as permitted above, be liable to\\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or out of\\ninability to use The Program (including, but not limited to, loss of\\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\\na result of any failure of The Program to operate with any other\\nprograms), even if The Copyright Holder or said author or said other\\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages. \\n\\nHow to Use This License\\n-----------------------\\nTo use this license, place in each of the files of your program both\\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also\\na statement that the distribution and/or modification of the file is\\nconstrained by the conditions in this license. \\n\\nNoting Exceptional Files\\n\\nIf The Program contains any files bearing additional conditions on\\nmodification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those\\nfiles (other than those listed in `Additional Conditions on LaTeX\\nSoftware Files'), then it is recommended that The Program contain a\\nprominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either\\nlists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of\\nexceptional files. \\n\\nFiles containing the text of a license (such as this file) are\\noften examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on\\nmodification. \\n\\n\"}, 'Commercial Use': {'lines': [], 'content': ''}, 'Relicense': {'lines': [], 'content': ''}, 'Hold Liable': {'lines': [13, 62],

to)\\nmaking any electronic components of the Work accessible by\\nfile transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file\\nsystems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS). \\n\\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\\n===========================================\\n1. \\n\\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work\\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. \\n\\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\\nreceived it. \\n\\nDistribution of only part of the Work is considered\\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause. \\n\\nYou may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that\\nthe recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly\\nas it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work\\ndirectly from the Work. \\n\\nYou may\\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work. \\n\\nDerived Works\\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to\\nbe updated versions of the Work. \\n\\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. \\n\\nEvery component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\\ndetailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\\nprominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\\nof the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\\nof the changes. \\n\\nYou distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\\n\\n1. \\n\\nA complete, unmodified copy of the Work;\\nif your distribution of a modified component is made by\\noffering access to copy the modified component from a\\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\\nthe Work from the same or some similar place meets this\\ncondition, even though third parties are not compelled to\\ncopy the Work along with the modified component;\\n\\n2. \\n\\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\\nWork, and

of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\\napplying that process. \\n\\nA Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\\nprovided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\\nClause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have\\nto honor the rest of the conditions in this license. \\n\\nIf a Derived Work is distributed under

without\\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. \\n\\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,\\nand compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on\\nthe Derived Work. \\n\\nEvery component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\\ndetailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\\nprominent reference to another file that is distributed as part\\nof the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log\\nof the changes. \\n\\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not\\napply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it\\nbecomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as\\nit is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above. \\n\\nDistribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or\\nnullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\\napplying that process. \\n\\nIf a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that\\nDerived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\\nitself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the\\nrestrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work. \\n\\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\\nwill The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the\\nWork, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as\\npermitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,\\nspecial, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of\\nthe Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited\\nto, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by\\nanyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages. \\n\\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there\\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\\nsignificant signs of active maintenance. \\n\\nabove\\nand after three months your intention is challenged neither by\\nthe Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other\\npeople, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as\\nto name you as the (new) Current Maintainer. \\n\\nIf the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes\\nreachable once more within three months of a change completed\\nunder the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must\\nbecome or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided\\nthey then update their communication data within one month. \\n\\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license. \\n\\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\\ndistributing the modified component. \\n\\nWhile you might intend that such\\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\\naccident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or\\nit may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\\ncause problems for the community. \\n\\nMany works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\\nwithout altering any of its licensed components. \\n\\nInclude also a\\nstatement that the distribution and/or modification of that\\ncomponent is constrained by the conditions in this license. \\n\\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\\nWork, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'. \\n\\n\"}, 'Commercial Use': {'lines': [], 'content': ''}, 'Relicense': {'lines': [], 'content': ''}, 'Hold Liable': {'lines': [8, 72, 144], 'content': 'We, the LaTeX3 Project,
